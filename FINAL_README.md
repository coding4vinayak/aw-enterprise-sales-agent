## 🗄️ Database Compatibility

The application works with any PostgreSQL-compatible database:

- **Standard PostgreSQL** (12+)  
- **TimescaleDB** (PostgreSQL extension for time-series)
- **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL**
- **Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL**
- **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**
- **Heroku Postgres**
- **Aiven PostgreSQL**
- **DigitalOcean Managed Databases**

### Connection Configuration

The application connects using a standard PostgreSQL connection string:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database_name
```

For TimescaleDB (which is PostgreSQL-compatible):
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://tsdbadmin:x2vm5sx9l1twlyzv@de65epw0cu.bc4seyfffs.tsdb.cloud.timescale.com:35895/tsdb?sslmode=require
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone and setup backend**:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Set environment variables**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database connection and API keys
```

3. **Apply database migrations**:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

4. **Start backend**:
```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

5. **Setup and start frontend**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- PII protection and data redaction
- SOC 2 and GDPR compliance features
- Audit logging with tamper resistance
- SSO integration (Okta, Azure AD, Google)

## 📊 Observability

- Metrics collection with Prometheus
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- Structured JSON logging
- Health checks and performance monitoring
- Usage analytics and cost tracking

## 📈 Multi-Tenant Architecture

- Complete tenant data isolation
- Usage-based billing metrics
- Tenant-specific configurations
- Role-based access controls
- Audit trails per tenant

## 🤖 AI Agent Architecture

Built with LangGraph for reliable agent execution:

```
[Research] → [Enrich] → [Draft] → [Verify] → [Execute]
    ↑                                      ↓
[Planning] ← [Reflection] ← [Tool Use] ← [Decision]
```

- ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern
- Tool orchestration for research and CRM sync
- Memory management for context
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

## 🔄 CRM Integration

Modular adapter pattern for easy CRM expansion:

```
SalesAgent → CRMAdapter → [HubSpot|Salesforce|Pipedrive|...] 
```

Each CRM adapter implements the same interface for:
- Contact/lead management
- Activity logging
- Note creation
- Opportunity tracking

## 📊 Analytics & Reporting

- Real-time usage metrics
- Agent performance metrics
- Cost tracking per tenant/user
- Campaign effectiveness analysis
- API rate limiting and quotas

## 🏗️ Deployment

The application supports multiple deployment options:

### Docker Compose
```yaml
